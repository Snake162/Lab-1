CSCI-2467 Lab 1 – Calculate Volume of a Cylinder Background The formula for the volume of a cylinder of radius r and height h is: πr2h  
Assignment Write a Java program that asks the user for the radius and height of a cylinder. 
The program should then calculate and print the volume of the cylinder.
Be sure to include a comment in your code with your name, date, and the purpose of the program.
Start your program as follows: 
package edu.cscc; 
import java.lang.Math; 
import java.util.Scanner;  
// TODO - add a comment with your name, date, and program purpose here 
public class Main {     
private static Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);      
public static void main(String[] args) {         
double radius, height, volume;         
// TODO - write your program here     
}
} 
Use the built-in Java constant Math.PI for the value of π. Example Output
Enter the radius of the cylinder: 2 
Enter the height of the cylinder: 10 
The volume of the cylinder is: 125.66370614359172
